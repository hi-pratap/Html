- Spring Boot Actuator is a module that provides monitoring and management capabilities for Spring Boot applications. It exposes various endpoints to gather metrics, health information, manage configuration, and more.

### 10. What is the purpose of the @RestController annotation in Spring MVC?

- The @RestController annotation is a specialized version of the @Controller annotation in Spring MVC. It combines the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations, simplifying the creation of RESTful APIs by eliminating the need to annotate each method with @ResponseBody.

### 11. What is the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository annotations in Spring?

- `@Component` is a generic annotation indicating a class as a Spring-managed component.
- `@Service` is a specialization of `@Component` used for declaring business services, and
- `@Repository` is a specialization used for data access objects.

### 12. How does Spring support method-level security?

- Spring provides method-level security through annotations such as @Secured, @PreAuthorize, and @PostAuthorize. These annotations allow you to specify access control rules and perform authorization checks at the method level.

### 13. What is the purpose of the @RequestMapping annotation in Spring MVC?

- The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map HTTP requests to specific handler methods in Spring MVC. It allows you to define the URL path, HTTP method, request parameters, and more.

### 14. How can you handle exceptions in Spring MVC?

- Spring MVC provides various mechanisms to handle exceptions, such as the @ExceptionHandler annotation to define exception handlers, global exception handling using @ControllerAdvice, and custom exception resolvers.

### 15. Explain the Spring Boot auto-configuration feature.

- Spring Boot auto-configuration

automatically configures beans and components based on the classpath and specific conditions. It eliminates the need for manual configuration in many cases, providing a convenient way to set up an application with sensible defaults.

### 16. What is Spring Boot's opinionated view on project structure?

- Spring Boot follows a convention-over-configuration approach for project structure. It recommends a specific structure where the main application class resides in the root package, and various components, configuration files, and resources are organized accordingly.

### 17. What is Spring Boot DevTools?

- Spring Boot DevTools is a development-time module that provides various features to enhance the development experience, such as automatic restarts, live reloading of static resources, and improved error reporting.

### 18. How can you externalize configuration properties in Spring Boot?

- Spring Boot allows you to externalize configuration properties using property files (e.g., application.properties or application.yml), environment variables, command-line arguments, and more.

### 19. Explain the concept of profiles in Spring Boot.

- Profiles in Spring Boot allow you to define different configurations for different environments or scenarios. By activating specific profiles, you can control which beans and configurations are loaded based on the environment or specific criteria.

### 20. What is the purpose of Spring Boot Actuator's health endpoint?

- The health endpoint in Spring Boot Actuator provides information about the health of the application. It can be used for monitoring and is commonly used by external monitoring systems to determine if the application is running correctly.

### 21. How can you implement caching in Spring?

- Spring provides caching support through abstractions such as the @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict annotations. By adding caching annotations to methods, you can cache the results and improve performance.

### 22. What is Spring Security's role-based access control (RBAC)?

- Role-based access control (RBAC) is a security mechanism where access rights are granted based on user roles. Spring Security provides RBAC support through authentication, authorization, and the management of user roles and permissions.

### 23. How can you implement internationalization (i18n) in Spring MVC?

- Spring MVC supports internationalization through resource bundles and the use of message source beans. By defining message properties for different languages, you can provide localized content in your application.

### 24. Explain the difference between constructor injection and setter injection in Spring.

- Constructor injection involves providing dependencies through constructor parameters, while setter injection involves using setter methods to inject dependencies. Constructor injection is generally recommended for mandatory dependencies, while setter injection is suitable for optional dependencies.

### 25. How can you handle form submissions in Spring MVC?

- Spring MVC provides form handling support through the @ModelAttribute annotation and the use of model attributes. By binding form inputs to Java objects, you can easily handle and validate form submissions.

### 26. What is the purpose of the @Transactional annotation in Spring?

- The @Transactional annotation is used to define transactional behavior for methods or classes in Spring. It ensures that the annotated methods run within a transaction, providing consistency and isolation for database operations.

### 27. How does Spring Boot handle error handling and reporting?

- Spring Boot provides default error handling and reporting mechanisms. It includes error pages, error handling for RESTful APIs, and customizable error responses based on content negotiation.

### 28. What is the Spring Boot CommandLineRunner interface used for?

- The CommandLineRunner interface in Spring Boot allows you to run specific code blocks on application startup. It is commonly used for initializing application data or performing additional setup tasks.
